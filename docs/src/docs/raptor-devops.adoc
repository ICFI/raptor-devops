== Overview

This project demonstrates an automated process to deploy a CI/CD environment with several project build quality and
security tools incorporated.

== Building

=== Prerequisite

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 8 JDK^]: Download from Oracle or
    use a packaged version for your OS

=== Project

. Execute the command `./mvnw verify` on Mac or Linux or `./mvnw.cmd verify` on Windows
    ** To build the documentation run with the docs profile activated ex: `./mvnw -P docs -pl docs package`

== Deployment

=== Using Sceptre

This is an optional tool to deploy the solution as the `cloudformation/templates/devsecops-stack.yaml` template
can be uploaded directly to the CloudFormation console if desired. Sceptre makes deployments via the CLI much easier
and is the recommended approach. To gather the needed information and pass arguments to the tool a Makefile has also
been included at the root of the project so deployments can be as easy as `make [create|update|delete]` Sceptre is a
Python tool and can be installed using pip.

==== Prerequisite (recommended)

. Python 2.7.x
. Make

==== Steps

. Install Make
. Execute the `make init` target which will install virtualenv and initialize Python dependencies in an isolated environment
    for this project.
. Activate the environment by running the command `source deploy/bin/activate`
. Review the configuration settings in `cloudformation/config/dev` if different region and availability zones are desired
. The commands to work with CloudFormation are now `make [create|update|delete]`
. Updates to the template can be syntax checked with the command `make validate`
. Once the stack has been launched the outputs can be retrieved with `make outputs` in our example you should you'll see
    the version of the stack returned

== Tools

* Project Build and Packaging:
    ** https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] is a software project management tool used to build and package the project
*Application Platform:
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[AWS EC2 Container Service^] is a highly scalable, high performance container
        management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed
        cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
* Deployment Orchestration
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to
        create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable
        fashion.
    ** https://sceptre.cloudreach.com[Sceptre^] is a tool to drive Cloudformation. Sceptre manages the creating, updating and
        deletion of stacks, and provides meta commands to allow users to get information about their stacks.
* Documentation:
    ** http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor^] markup and transformation is used to create the documentation
