== Overview

This project demonstrates an automated process to deploy an environment to AWS that will push updates into
production in response to code updates.

== Deployment

=== Prerequisites

* An AWS account with administrative privileges as the solution creates IAM roles for the service
* https://git-scm.com/[Git^]: Download the git version control system or use a packaged version for your OS
* A https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/[GitHub Account^]
* A https://github.com/settings/tokens[GitHub Access Token^] is required to set the repository hook that starts the
    build and deploy process immediately after new code commits have been pushed

==== Steps to Deploy

* *Fork the code respository:* Go the the https://github.com/ICFI/raptor-devops[GitHub repository web page^] for this project and click the
    Fork button in the top right hand side of the page. This will create a copy of the code in your own account
* *Clone the fork:* Run the command `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/raptor-devops` and change into
    the raptor-devops directory. This is the workspace from which you can make changes to see the automated process
    run shortly after you push your commits to GitHub
* *Launch the CloudFormation Stack:* Log into your AWS account and then use one of the links below to launch the CloudFormation
    stack.
.CloudFormation Launch Links
|===
|Region |Launch Template

|N. Virginia (us-east-1)
|https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=raptor-devops&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/raptor-devops-deployment-us-east-1/raptor-devops-template.yaml[launch^]

|Ohio (us-east-2)
|https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-2#/stacks/new?stackName=raptor-devops&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/raptor-devops-deployment-us-east-2/raptor-devops-template.yaml[launch^]

|Oregon (us-west-2)
|https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=raptor-devops&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/raptor-devops-deployment-us-east-1/raptor-devops-template.yaml[launch^]

|===
* *Enter Your Account Info:* Enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token as parameters to the stack. All other params
    can be left at their default settings. This access to your account allows CodeDeploy to receive push notifications when
    new code is pushed. The token needs to have `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes authorized.

* *Check the Output Links:* After launch of the stack if you look at the CloudFormation console you'll see a number of
    stacks under creation and eventually reaching the CREATE_COMPLETE status. Click on the parent stack, which has a short name
    like DevSecOps and look in the Outputs tab to get links to the Pipeline URL to watch the CI/CD process in action and also
    direct links to the Hello World greeting endpoint and a version endpoint from which you can see that the application
    was freshly compiled and deployed immediately following the launch of the stack.
* *Push a Change* Make a change to any of the project code, commit and then push it back to GitHub and shortly thereafter
    the build and deploy process will automatically restart and if tests pass the application will be redeployed.

==== Steps to Undeploy

When finished with the solution follow the steps below to remove all resources provisioned.

. *Delete the Web Service* From the CloudFormation console locate the stack that ends in -Service. This is the running application and must be
    deleted prior to the rest of the stack. Tick the checkbox and then use Actions->Delete Stack to remove
. *Delete the Stacks* Once the web service stack has been deleted tick the checkbox next to the parent stack, "DevSecOps"
    and use Actions->Delete Stack to remove
. *Delete the S3 bucket* The bucket containing the build artifacts produced by the CI/CD process
. *Delete the container repo* The ECR contains the Docker images created by the CI/CD process

== Tools

* Project Build and Packaging:
    ** https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] is a software project management tool used to build and package the project
*Application Platform:
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/[AWS EC2 Container Service^] is a highly scalable, high performance container
        management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed
        cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
* Deployment Orchestration
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to
        create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable
        fashion.
* Documentation:
    ** http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor^] markup and transformation is used to create the documentation
