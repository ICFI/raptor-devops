== Overview

This project demonstrates an automated process to deploy an environment to AWS that will push updates into
production in response to code updates.

== Deployment

=== Prerequisites

* An AWS account with administrative privileges as the solution creates IAM roles for the service
* https://git-scm.com/[Git^]: Download the git version control system or use a packaged version for your OS
* A https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/[GitHub Account^]
* A https://github.com/settings/tokens[GitHub Access Token^] is required to set the repository hook that starts the
    build and deploy process immediately after new code commits have been pushed. The token needs to have `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes authorized
    https://github.com/ICFI/raptor-devops/raw/master/docs/src/docs/images/token-scopes.png[(screenshot)^].

=== Steps to Deploy

* *Fork the code repository:* Go the https://github.com/ICFI/raptor-devops[GitHub repository web page^] for this project and click the
    Fork button in the top right-hand side of the page. This will create a copy of the code in your own account
* *Clone your fork:* Run the command `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/raptor-devops` and change into
    the raptor-devops directory. This is the workspace from which you can make changes to see the automated process
    run shortly after you push your commits to GitHub
* *Launch the CloudFormation Stack:* Log into the AWS account and then use one of the links below to launch the CloudFormation
    stack.
.CloudFormation Launch Links

|===
* *Restrict Access* Enter the allowed IP addresses that will be able to access the solution. You can find your address
    http://checkip.amazonaws.com[using a number of online pages^], remember to add the /32 at the end to limit to just your address.
* *Enter Your Account Info:* Enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token as parameters to the stack. All other params
    can be left at their default settings. This access to your account allows Code Pipeline to receive push notifications when
    new code is pushed. The token needs to have `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes authorized
    https://github.com/ICFI/raptor-devops/raw/master/docs/src/docs/images/token-scopes.png[(screenshot)^].
* *Check the Output Links:* After launch of the stack if you look at the CloudFormation console you'll see a number of
    stacks under creation and eventually reaching the CREATE_COMPLETE status. Click on the parent stack, which has a short name
    like DevSecOps and look in the Outputs tab to get links to the Pipeline URL to watch the CI/CD process in action and also
    direct links to the Hello World greeting endpoint and a version endpoint from which you can see that the application
    was freshly compiled and deployed immediately following the launch of the stack.
* *Push a Change* Make a change to any of the project code, commit and then push it back to GitHub and shortly thereafter
    the build and deploy process will automatically restart and if tests pass the application will be redeployed.

== Review Deployment

Once the initial five CloudFormation infrastructure stacks have completed deployment navigate to the Outputs tab of the parent
stack (raptor-devops) and open the *PipelineURL* link to watch the CI/CD process in action. Code Pipeline performs a
three-step process to build and deploy the project.

. Code Pipeline checks out the code from the _forked_ GitHub project and sets a hook so when future commits are pushed the pipeline will
    be notified.
. Code Pipeline next uses a Code Build project build and package the api application artifact
    ** Compiles the code into a war file using a Docker container
    ** Creates a Docker image containing the application for use when deploying to ECS
    ** Pushes the application to ECR, which we're using to host our private container images

        pre_build:
          commands:
            - $(aws ecr get-login)
            - TAG="$(echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION | head -c 8)"
        build:
          commands:
            - docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/tmp/api -w /tmp/api maven:3.5-jdk-8 mvn -pl app/api verify
            - docker build -t api app/api
            - docker tag api:latest "${REPOSITORY_URI}:${TAG}"
        post_build:
          commands:
            - docker push "${REPOSITORY_URI}:${TAG}"

. The last step is Code Pipeline pulls the newly created application container image from ECR and either deploys
    the CloudFormation service stack that launches the api or if already deployed performs an update to launch
    the version that corresponds with the latest code commit.
. Once the Code Pipeline has completed the first deployment you'll be able to use the other two links listed in the
    Outputs tab to view the deployed application.
    ** *GreetingUrl:* This link is to the `/greet` endpoint of the api application deployed as a container within ECS.
        The output is in json format as the application function is that as an api providing information to possibly
        many different front-end UIs.
    ** *VersionUrl:* When the application is built timestamp and other information is captured and written into the
        final artifact to allow for version information to be discoverable. Notice that the timestamp shows that
        the application was just built on demand when you launched the stack.
. Make a change, commit and push in the local repo we cloned right after forking the project. We've authorized
    GitHub to notify CodePipeline when new code is pushed so this should trigger a redeployment of the api application
    which can be followed from the *PipelineURL* link. Verify the redeployment by checking the timestamp of the api
    application again after the pipeline completes.

== Steps to Undeploy

When finished with the solution follow the steps below to remove all resources provisioned.

. *Delete the Web Service* From the CloudFormation console locate the stack that ends in -Service. This is the running application and must be
    deleted prior to the rest of the stack. Tick the checkbox and then use Actions->Delete Stack to remove
. *Delete the Stacks* Once the web service stack has been deleted tick the checkbox next to the parent stack, "DevSecOps"
    and use Actions->Delete Stack to remove
. *Delete the S3 bucket* The bucket containing the build artifacts produced by the CI/CD process
. *Delete the container repo* The ECR contains the Docker images created by the CI/CD process
